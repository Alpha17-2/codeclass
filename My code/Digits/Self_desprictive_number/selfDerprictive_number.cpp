    !    SELF DESCRIPTIVE NUMBER
A self-descriptive number is an integer n in given base b is b digits long in which each digit at position p (the most significant digit being at position 0 and the least significant at position b â€“ 1) counts how many times a digit p is in n. 
For example in base 10, 6210001000 is a self descriptive number. 

Explanation : 
It is 10 digit number in base 10. 
It has 6 at the position 0 and there are six 0s in 6210001000. 
It has 2 at the position 1 and there are two 1s in 6210001000. 
It has 1 at the position 2 and there is one 2s in 6210001000. 
It has 0 at the position 3 and there are zero 3s in 6210001000. 
It has 0 at the position 4 and there are zero 4s in 6210001000. 
It has 0 at the position 5 and there are zero 5s in 6210001000. 
It has 1 at the position 6 and there is one 6 in 6210001000. 
It has 0 at the position 7 and there are zero 7s in 6210001000. 
It has 0 at the position 8 and there are zero 8s in 6210001000. 
It has 0 at the position 9 and there are zero 9s in 6210001000.

* Description of Program : 
1 . Firstly all the digits get extracted from the outer loop and are stored in a variable b in each 
iteration. 
2 . Then in the inner loop there is a count on how many times number i (this i is ith index of outer loop)
is present in the string. 
3 . Finally that count is compared with the digit present at the ith index stored in variable b.
